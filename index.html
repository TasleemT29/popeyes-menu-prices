        <p class="text-lg mb-4">Popeyes is famous for its crispy fried chicken, tasty sides, and buttery biscuits. But what makes it even better? Getting your meal at a great price! Whether you’re craving a Chicken Sandwich, Family Meal, or the popular Tuesday Special, there are many ways to save.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500 mt-6 mb-2">Save with Combo Meals</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">One of the best ways to save money is by choosing Popeyes combo meals. These usually include a main dish, side, and drink — all for a lower price than buying each item separately. The Chicken Sandwich Combo or the 2-Piece Chicken Combo are both filling and budget-friendly.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500 mt-6 mb-2">Family Meals for Bigger Savings</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">If you’re feeding the family, Popeyes’ Family Meals are a great option. These meals come with plenty of chicken, sides, and biscuits — perfect for sharing without spending too much.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500 mt-6 mb-2">Don’t Miss the Tuesday Special</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The Tuesday Special is a fan favorite and a must-try deal. Every Tuesday, you can grab a 2-piece chicken (usually a leg and a thigh) for a lower price than normal. It’s a simple and affordable way to enjoy your Popeyes favorites.</p>
